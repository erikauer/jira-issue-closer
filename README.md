# JIRA Issue Transitioner 

A JIRA issue transitioner written in groovy that closes all issues found by a specified JQL.

## Getting Started

Steps

* clone the repository
* build the project with ./gradlew build
* Setup the environment (Shown in detail below in deployment section)
* Run the project with ./gradle run

## Running the tests

Run

    ./gradlew test
    
from the root directory.

## Deployment

To deploy the JIRA Issue Transitioner successful you need to set the JIRA URL through the environment variable

     JIRAISSUETRANSITIONER_URL
     
 You also need to set values for the jql (JIRAISSUETRANSITIONER_JQL) and the transitionId 
 (JIRAISSUETRANSITIONER_TRANSITION) for a successful run of this program. An configuration example:
 
     export JIRAISSUETRANSITIONER_URL=http://private-58204-jiraissuetransitionertestmock.apiary-mock.com
     export JIRAISSUETRANSITIONER_JQL="?jql=project%3Ddevops%20and%20status%3Dabnahmebereit%20and%20updated<%3D-14d"
     export JIRAISSUETRANSITIONER_TRANSITION=22
     
You can set JIRAISSUETRANSITIONER_DRYRUN to true, if you want to test a transition. This configuration is
convenient if you want to initially configure the issue transitioner for your environment.
